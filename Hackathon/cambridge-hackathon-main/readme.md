## Introduction

The hackathon is designed to give you hands-on experience with:  
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Utilising Neuphonic's API for Voice Synthesis.  
- **Speech-to-Speech (TTS):** Utilising Neuphonic's API for Conversational AI

In what follows, we'll show you how to get started and use our software!

## Setup

### Project Structure
```bash
├── react-hook                      # Contains a react hook impl, if required
├── LICENSE                         # MIT License
├── Quickstart.ipynb                # JupyterNotebook going over various helpful examples
├── README.md                       # Documentation
└── requirements.txt                # Dependencies
```

### Prerequisites

You will need to be running a minimum of Python 3.10+.

### Getting Started

Start by cloning this repository. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/neuphonic/cambridge-hackathon.git
cd cambridge-hackathon
```

Set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies.
There are multiple ways to create a virtual environment (e.g., conda, venv, etc.), so feel free to use your preferred method.
Here is an example using Python's built-in venv module:

**Linux/Mac**
```bash
python -m venv neuphonic_venv
source neuphonic_venv/bin/activate 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Windows**
```cmd
python -m venv neuphonic_venv
neuphonic_venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then head over to the [https://docs.neuphonic.com/quickstart](https://docs.neuphonic.com/quickstart) 
section of our docs for instructions on how to get started where we demonstrate
1. How to get your API key.
2. How to run some example applications.

> :warning: Mac users may encounter a `'portaudio.h' file not found` when trying to play audio or install
> `pyaudio`. You can resolve this error by running `brew install portaudio`. 
> Install `brew` at [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/) if you don't have it already.

Additionally, you can explore the `Quickstart.ipynb` Jupyter notebook, which guides you through 
performing text-to-speech using the Neuphonic API and utilizing our Agents (Chatbot) feature.

Explore the rest of our documentation to see what other features we have!
